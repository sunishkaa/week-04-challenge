loading libraries
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(sjmisc)
library(ggplot2)
library(skimr)
library(kableExtra)
```


Step1:

Creating function load_dictionary that takes single argument, "filename", which can be used to read in either of the two text files
```{r}
load_dictionary <- function(filename) {
a = read.delim(filename) 
return(a$words) 
#a$words
}
```


Creating variables "solution_list" and "valid_list" that respectively contain vectors of possible solution words and valid words
```{r}
valid_list <- load_dictionary("collins-scrabble-words-2019.txt")
solution_list <- load_dictionary("google-10000-english-usa-no-swears.txt")
str(valid_list)
str(solution_list)
```

Step 2:

Winnowing "solution_list" to only include words included in "valid_list"
```{r}
solution_list_updated <- intersect(solution_list, valid_list)
solution_list_updated
```

Step 3:

Writing custom function pick_solution() that:
1) removes all words from solution_list that are not 5 letters in length 
2) randomly chooses a single word from those that remain 
3) then splits that word into a vector of single-character elements
```{r}
pick_solution <- function(solv.list){
  lista = solv.list[nchar(solv.list) == 5]
  listb = sample(lista, 1)
  str_extract_all(listb, boundary("character"))[[1]]
  return(str_extract_all(listb, boundary("character"))[[1]])
}
solution <- pick_solution(solution_list_updated)
```


Step 4:

Comparing guess word to the solution word and generate necessary feedback
```{r}
helper_function <- function(guess, solution){
  #can just use "guess" and "solution" in helper function without need to split them into vectors 
  #setting up for loop going through each letter in "guess"
output.variable = c("-","-","-","-","-")                 #setting i to 1

for (i in 1:length(guess)){ 
for (j in 1:length(solution)){
  if (guess[i] == solution[j]){
      if (i == j){
        output.variable[i] = "*"
         }
         else{
           output.variable[i] = "+"
     }
    } 
   }
  }
  return(output.variable)
}

```


Writing play_wordle function
```{r}
play_wordle <- function(solution, valid_list, num_guesses=6){
  print("You have 6 chances to guess a word of length 5")
  print("Letters left:")
  print(toString(LETTERS))
  guess_count <- 1
  while (guess_count <= num_guesses) {
    guess <- readline(paste0("Enter guess number " , guess_count, " then press Enter: "))
    guess <- toupper(guess)
    print(guess)
    guess.str_extract <- str_extract_all(guess, boundary("character"))[[1]]
    if (guess %in% valid_list & length(guess.str_extract) == 5){ 
      print("This is a valid guess")
      result <- helper_function(guess.str_extract, solution) #use helper function to evaluate guess vs. solution
      print(result) 
      if (result == c("*", "*", "*", "*", "*")){                                        #if helper function's output == solution
           print("You win!")
           return()
        }
      if (guess_count > 6) {
        print("You lose")
        return()
        }#then player wins the game
      
    }
    guess_count <- guess_count+1
  }
}
  
```

play_wordle(solution, valid_list, num_guesses=6)
